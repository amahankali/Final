Plan to implement flat shading
1. Include light, ambient, constants commands in my_main
2. Figure out how to get the draw.c methods to account for these factors when drawing.
	Arguments Needed in draw.c:
		- Ambient light: (r, g, b)
		- Point light source: (x, y, z, r, g, b)
		- Constants of the surface
	Functions to change:
		- scan_line
		- draw_polygons
		- draw_line (Flat shading is easier, since we do not actually have to modify draw_line)
3. Update the sections in my_main which account for these - for each solid
